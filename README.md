# General DDNS

- This is a fork of a Traefik middleware ip whitelist DDNS. I use it as a base for my own DDNS script, assisting me in managing my personal home lab DDNS.
- No Plans to maintain or expand this script more than what I am using it for, if you want to use it, feel free to do so. :D

## ENV needed + Explanation


---
# Keep as Ref. , from original README.md

This is a simple Traefik v2 DDNS updater script, which can be used in home lab setups to synchronize the allowed IP addresses for your [IP Whitelist Middleware](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/ipwhitelist/), which allows you to configure a VPN protected setup for your applications. It also support setting a custom domain for its IP(s) to be added to the whitelist range of the middleware.

## Requirements

* The installation must be inside the Traefik namespace in the cluster, as it uses the `traefik` service account to run.

## Things it does

* Creates a role and role binding objects which allow the script to patch middleware objects inside the Traefik namespace.

* Creates a middleware for IP whitelisting which can later be injected into the Ingress Route objects.

* Creates a cronjob which runs every X minutes and updates the allowed IP in the middleware to your own.

## Installing with Helm

There is a helm chart available as well. Check [the ArtifactHub page](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/kubitodev/traefik-whitelist-ddns) for more details.

## Installing with `kubectl`

Go inside the `manifests` directory and change anything you'd like in the manifests. You can leave the IP in the middleware to the default value, it will get updated anyway. Especially take a look at the environment variables set in the cronjob manifest, as you might want to replace them. To install, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests --namespace <TRAEFIK_NAMESPACE>
```
